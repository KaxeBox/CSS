     /*for each parent classify the different tags (by types) into different boxes and maintain the order in which they appear in html doc, then see which element is required in the css selector and pick the first of that css selector's tag's box */
     /* For example here we have div-box1, p,p, div-box2 these 4 children. Putting them into boxes(or types) we have div and p. Now looking at the selector we find that we need the p box and in the p box we need first p */
     /* FOLLOW BELOW IDEA */
     /* First go to second last element in selector , then go to pseduo class, there once we see the word 'type' go back to identify kiska 'type' chahiye -wo kya hota h? last element in selector . then after gathering the 'type' elements pick up te first of each groups */
